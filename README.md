# AdblockIE
AdblockIE is an ad blocker for Internet Explorer, inspired by Firefox's Adblock and Noscript (as well as Safari's PithHelmet and IE7Pro). 

Was formerly at [adblockie.codeplex.com/](http://adblockie.codeplex.com/). Not
maintained anymore, but still here for historical reference. Probably still
works.
